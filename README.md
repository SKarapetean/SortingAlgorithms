Java Sorting Algorithms
This is a Java-based program that implements four different sorting algorithms for both primitive (int) and generic types: bubble sort, selection sort, insertion sort, and quick sort.

Sorting Algorithms
Bubble Sort
This is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly iterates through the list, comparing adjacent elements and swapping them if they are in the wrong order. It has a time complexity of O(n^2).

Selection Sort
This is another simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly selects the minimum element from the unsorted portion of the list and swaps it with the first element of the unsorted portion. It has a time complexity of O(n^2).

Insertion Sort
This is a sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted list one item at a time. It takes each element and inserts it into the correct position in the sorted portion of the list. It has a time complexity of O(n^2).

Quick Sort
This is a divide-and-conquer sorting algorithm that picks an element as a pivot and partitions the array around the pivot. It has a time complexity of O(n log n).

Customizing
If you want to customize the Java Sorting Algorithms program, you can modify the existing classes or create new subclasses to implement additional sorting algorithms. You can also modify the SortTester class to test the new algorithms with different input data.

Requirements
Java 8 or higher
